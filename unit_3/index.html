<p>Joe Dolack has been an artist all his life but it wasn't until after graduating college that he started to really explore and experiment in the world of art. It started as a hobby painting portraits of friend's favorite celebs on brightly colored collaged backgrounds, to now shipping commissioned pieces all over the U.S. </p>
